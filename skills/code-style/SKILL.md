# Coding Style Rules

Apply these rules when writing or modifying code. **Applies everywhere including plans, explanations, and example code.** No exceptions.

## Control Flow Braces

All control statements (`if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `do`) MUST use braces `{}` with body on a new line. Never omit braces or write single-line bodies.

## No Early Void Return / Guard Throw — Use if-else or Check Functions

Value-returning early returns (`return false`, `return 0`) are allowed. **Void returns and guard throws to exit a function are not.** Single condition: use if-else. Multiple conditions: extract to a check function (see check function pattern below).

## Positive Conditions First

Prefer positive conditions over negated (`!`) conditions. Exception: simple conditions without else where negation is natural.

## Always Write Explicit else

When if branches return values or diverge processing, **always wrap the last branch in else**. Don't fall through past if to return.

## No Unnecessary `return undefined`

When return type includes `undefined`, don't write `else { return undefined; }` or `else { return; }`. Just omit the else block.

## Strict Equality Only

Always use `===`/`!==`. Never use `==`/`!=`.

## Nullish Checks

For null+undefined checks, prefer in this order:

1. **Truthy check** (default): `if (value)` / `if (!value)` — when `0`, `""`, `false` are NOT valid values
2. **Explicit comparison** (when `0`/`""`/`false` are valid): `value === undefined || value === null` (or `value !== undefined && value !== null`)

## File Top Structure: import → type → interface → const

Order file top sections with **one blank line** between sections:
1. **import / require**
2. **type aliases** (`type Foo = ...`)
3. **interface definitions** (`interface Foo { ... }`)
4. **const/let declarations**

## Import Ordering

Order imports by group, no blank lines between groups:

1. **Node.js built-ins** (`events`, `fs`, `path`, `net`, etc.)
2. **External packages** (`axios`, `lodash`, `ws`, etc.)
3. **Internal modules** (relative `./` `../` imports)
4. **Internal constants** (large destructured imports like `define/property`)
5. **`import type`** (always last)

Multiline destructured imports (4+ items) use one item per line with trailing comma.

## Imports at File Top Only

All `import`/`require` at file top. No inline `import()` or `require()` mid-code. No `import('path').Type` inline type references. If inline import is unavoidable (circular dependency), explain and get user approval.

## Line Wrapping Style

When wrapping a line over 120 chars: **one item per line** (destructuring, literals, params, args, imports) and **trailing operator** (`&&`, `||` at line end, not line start). Exceptions: type union `|` stays **leading**, ternary `?`/`:` stays **leading**, intersection `&` stays trailing. For long `if`/`while` conditions, break right after `(` and put `)` on its own line. 문자열/템플릿 리터럴을 `+` 연결로 쪼개지 않는다 — 호출 구조를 줄바꿈하되 문자열 자체는 한 줄 유지 (120자 초과 시 예외 허용).

## Type/Interface Section — No Blank Lines Between

Type and interface declarations form one section. No blank lines between them. One blank line only after the entire section ends (before const).

## Blank Line After Variable Declarations

Consecutive `const`/`let`/`var` declarations form **one block**. No blank lines within the block. **One blank line after the block ends** — even before `return`. Applies to all blocks (function body, if, else, try, catch). Applies regardless of initializer form (simple value, object literal, multi-line callback).

## Blank Line Between Method/Function Definitions

Always one blank line between class members, methods, and function definitions.

## Class Member Ordering

Order class members:

1. **Static properties** (public → protected → private)
2. **Static methods** (public → protected → private) — type order below
3. **Instance properties** (public → protected → private)
4. **Constructor**
5. **Public instance methods** — type order below
6. **Protected instance methods** — type order below
7. **Private instance methods** — type order below

Static members come first because they're class-level utilities available without instantiation; instance code (including field initializers) may reference them.

Within each access level, order method groups as (Angular/React/C++ convention — lifecycle first, predicates last):

1. **Lifecycle** (in order): `dispose*` → `create*` → `init*` → `start*` → `stop*` → `reset*` → `remove*` → `clear*`
   - `dispose` is the destructor counterpart to constructor — placed at the very top of each access section.
2. **Event/communication**: `on*`, `handle*`, `*EventHandler`, `send*`, `notify*`
3. **Accessors**: `get*`, `set*`
4. **Data operations**: `add*`, `update*`, `find*`, `parse*`, `make*`, `record*`, `alloc*`/`unalloc*`
5. **Misc** — methods not matching any listed prefix, grouped by their own prefix
6. **Predicates** (near bottom): `has*`, `is*`, `check*` (individual → composite)

Same-prefix methods must be adjacent. The numbered order above is the default; adjust if a file's domain makes a different grouping more natural, but never scatter same-prefix methods.

## Method Naming Convention

All method and function names MUST use camelCase. PascalCase is reserved for classes, interfaces, types, and enums only.

## Avoid Filler Prepositions in Identifier Names

Avoid filler prepositions (`of`, `in`, `at`, `on`) in identifier names when they don't disambiguate. Use compound-noun form.

- `getNameOfPerson` → `getPersonName`
- `enablePropagationOfEstop` → `enableEstopPropagation`
- `listOfItems` → `items` or `itemList`

Keep meaningful prepositions (`to`, `from`, `by`, `with`) that express direction or relationship:

- `convertToString` (direction) ✓
- `parseFromJson` (origin) ✓
- `getWorkByAgvId` (relation) ✓
- `mergeWithDefault` (combine) ✓

## Minimum Access Exposure

Prefer the most restrictive access modifier: private > protected > public. Use public only for methods **actually called from outside the class hierarchy**. Use protected for methods used by subclasses. Default to private for everything else — including `get*`/`set*`/lifecycle methods with no external callers. Promote to public when needed; demotion is harder than promotion.

**No speculative exceptions**: interface implementations must match the interface. Everything else follows the "no external caller → private" rule strictly.

**Underscore prefix**: All non-public members (both `private` and `protected` — methods *and* fields) MUST use `_` prefix. Public members never use `_`. Rationale: the prefix gives a visible cue at call sites (`this._foo`) so consumers can spot accidental access to non-public API without jumping to the definition. Renaming a member's visibility therefore also renames it (and updates all call sites in the class hierarchy).

## No Unnecessary Blank Lines Inside Methods

Blank lines inside method bodies are allowed **only after variable declaration blocks**. No blank lines between execution statements, before/after `}` blocks, or before/after comments. Applies to nested blocks too.

## Remove Unnecessary async

Don't add `async` to functions that don't use `await`.

## Sync Return When Signature Allows

When the signature accepts both sync and async (`() => Promise<T> | void`), write sync logic without `Promise.resolve()` wrap or `async` keyword.

## Avoid Redundant State Checks

Don't evaluate the same state predicate twice in one code path; restructure to mutually exclusive `if-else-if` with early returns.

## State Owner Lives with Usage

Keep shared runtime state (registries, counters, flags) inside the producing closure; expose a single callable handle to outside callers instead of threading adapter closures through parameters.

## Concrete Verbs for Identifiers

Use concrete verbs that describe the specific action (add/remove, mark/unmark, register/unregister, enable/disable), not abstract verbs (watch, track, handle, manage) that delegate meaning to context.

## Extract Multi-Line Inline Arguments

Function arguments spanning 2+ lines (object literals, multi-property configs, multi-line arrow callbacks) should be extracted to a named local variable so the call site stays single-line and the name documents intent.

## Prefer const

Use `const` unless the variable is actually reassigned. `let` only for reassigned variables.

## Repeated Literals → Constants

String/number literals with structural meaning that appear **2+ times** should be defined as constants. Match the existing constant definition pattern (e.g. object form).

## Constant Location by Scope

- Referenced from multiple files → shared constant file (e.g. `property.js`)
- Used in one file/class only → file top or class internal

## Pure Helper Placement

Place pure helpers (no `this`) in the narrowest consumer scope: single-class → class member; multi-function in module → module-level const; cross-module → shared util. Within a class follow the Class Member Ordering rule.

## await Over Promise Chains

Use `async/await` + `try/catch` instead of `.then().catch()`.

## Floating Promises in Fan-out Callbacks

Inside fire-and-forget callbacks (forEach without await, event-emitter listeners, setInterval): never leave a Promise unhandled. Use `await Promise.allSettled([...].map(fn))` with per-result `if rejected` log for parallel fan-out, or `for-of + await + try/catch` for sequential. Per-promise `.catch()` chaining is forbidden — violates "Don't mix await with .catch()" and returns void instead of propagating reject to the caller's try-catch.

## Await Only Thenables

Never `await` a function with `void` or non-Promise return — silent no-op masking a sync/async mismatch. Verify callee's return type before adding `await`. If the callee body holds floating Promises (`.catch()` chains, fire-and-forget), the callee itself is mis-declared sync and must be converted to `async` with proper internal `await`; conversely, if a function is declared `async` but its body has no real await target, demote it to sync.

## Extract Long Inline Callbacks

Callbacks passed as parameters that exceed ~5 lines should be extracted to separate methods/functions.

## Direct Method Reference for Callbacks

Pass method references directly to callback APIs instead of wrapping in a lambda that just invokes them. Wrap only when args/return need adapting or extra logic is required. JS/TS: `setInterval(this._refresh, ms)` not `setInterval(() => { this._refresh(); }, ms)`. Same principle for other languages with first-class functions (Python `Timer(5, self.refresh)`, Java `this::refresh`, C# `this.Refresh`).

## try-catch Scope

Default: wrap **entire function body**. Partial try-catch only when error handling differs by section. Don't nest try-catch with identical error handling. Don't mix `await` with `.catch()`. Don't nest try-catch — extract inner logic to a separate method. Don't write consecutive try-catch in the same scope — merge into one try-catch or extract to separate methods.

**Handler/callback functions** (event handlers, setInterval/setTimeout, Express middleware): wrap **everything including variable declarations** in try-catch since errors can't propagate upward.

**Auxiliary functions** (logging, monitoring, metrics, diagnostics): when called inside another function's logic, must contain their own try-catch internally so they never propagate errors to the caller. Auxiliary work must not break primary logic.

## Variable Scope at try-catch Boundaries

`let`/`const` declared inside `try` are not visible in `catch`/`finally` (block-scoped) — declare them outside `try` when shared across blocks, and inside the block when used only there.

## User-Friendly Error Messages

Write error messages that non-technical people can understand. Avoid internal terms (tags, registers, instances).

## Avoid Abbreviations

Use full words in variable names, function names, and **type/interface names** unless the name becomes unreasonably long.

## Value Names Follow Source of Truth

When a data source (backend API, protocol, external system) already defines value names (enum values, status strings, constants), consumers MUST use the same names directly. Never create consumer-specific aliases that require a mapping layer (e.g. backend `'FULL'` → frontend `'fullCharge'`). Display labels that differ from data values belong in the rendering layer (e.g. a label map for UI text), not as renamed data values.

## check vs is Naming

| Prefix | Role | Returns | Example |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| `check` | Precondition validation, throws on failure | `void` | `checkConnection()` |
| `is` | State query | `boolean` | `isConnected()` |

check functions validate only — they don't return values. If you need the value, call check then get separately.

## Check Function Pattern

**Individual check**: validates one condition, throws on failure, returns void.
**Composite check**: combines individual checks. Don't inline conditions in composite — call individual checks. Place at class bottom: individual → composite order.

Use in methods: common preconditions via composite, method-specific conditions by combining composite + individual. Even single-use preconditions should be extracted to check functions. Don't branch check calls with if-else in method body — use composite with parameters.

## throw Over Promise.reject

In async functions: use `throw` not `Promise.reject`. Use `await this.send()` not `return this.send()`. Never use `new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => ...)` anti-pattern.

## Minimize Comments + Explicit Naming

No comments explaining "what" code does — use clear names instead. Only allow comments explaining "why". **Section divider comments are forbidden** in all forms (text, lines, emoji, `// ===`, `// ---`, `// MARK:`, `#region`, etc.).

## String Literal Constants

Repeated or meaningful string literals should be defined as `const` constants. Don't use string literals directly in function args, event types, identifiers.

## Minimize Duplicate Code

Extract identical code into shared functions. In switch-case: if all cases produce same result, put it outside switch. If results differ, set in each case.

## Name by Purpose, Not Input Shape

Name functions/utilities by **what they produce**, not what input shape they take. Same role + different input shapes → one name, handle shapes internally (overloads, conditional types, type guards).

## Function Name over Literal Argument

If an argument is always a literal at every call site (never dynamic), encode it in the function name instead of passing it (e.g. `claimInSlot()` / `claimOutSlot()` rather than `claimSlot('in' | 'out')`).

## No Duplicate Logic

Logic repeated in 2+ places → extract to a method. Check existing codebase for same patterns before writing new code.

## Boilerplate Belongs on the Owner

When two or more clients perform the same multi-line guard/narrow/query pattern against the same owner (e.g. `owner.getCurrent()` → `if (!== undefined && !== SENTINEL && .flag)` → invoke), the boilerplate belongs on the owner as a typed API, not as a shared helper outside the owner.

- Anti-pattern: two modules define `_registerXxxHandler` private methods, each performing identical narrowing on `taskControl.getCurrentTask()`. → Promote into `taskControl.registerXxxHandler(callback)` and call sites become one line.
- Anti-pattern: multiple consumers each implement the same `find by id + null check + cast` lookup. → Expose `findX(id): X | undefined` on the owner.

Rule of thumb: client code accessing owner internals with guards is a signal the owner is missing an API. Add the API on the owner.

**General API + specialized helper coexist on the owner**: When the owner already exposes a general API (`listenX`, `on`, `emit`) and clients wrap it with the same guard/check boilerplate, add a specialized helper on the owner that takes only the action-specific callback. The general API stays for arbitrary handlers; the specialized helper takes one line at the call site. Threshold: ~5+ lines of repeating boilerplate across 2+ clients warrants the specialized helper; less than that, direct use of the general API is fine.

## Named Alias for Complex Type Constraints

When `extends` condition in conditional types exceeds one line or same structure repeats 2+ times, extract to a named type alias.

## Resource Cleanup in Owner, Not Caller

Callback release, listener removal, schedule cancellation — place cleanup logic inside the method that owns the resource, not in callers. Otherwise other call paths may miss cleanup.

## Logging Quality

- Log constant/config values once at initialization, not on every call.
- Log state after the action (or in `finally`), not before — pre-action logs capture stale state.
- Skip logging when nothing meaningful changed (idle/zero state). Only log when there's actual activity or warning conditions.

## Post-Change Verification

After completing code changes, run `npx eslint` on changed files. Report new errors and warnings to user. Changes must not increase the ESLint error/warning count compared to before the change.
