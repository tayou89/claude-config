# Integration Testing Rules

Apply these rules when running integration/runtime tests against a live or simulated environment.

## 1. Verify Infrastructure First (Hard Prereq)

BEFORE starting any integration test, actively probe every external endpoint declared in the test config — `ping` the host AND TCP port-check each port. Log results visibly. If ANY endpoint is down, abort test and investigate the environment FIRST before assuming code bug. "Should be up" is not verification. When you see connection errors mid-test, return to this step before diagnosing as code.

## 2. Structured Test Execution

Organize tests bottom-up — unit-level module tests first, then controller/service tests, then end-to-end scenarios, then error/recovery, then soak tests. Track each test case with ID, status (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), and notes.

## 3. Monitor-Trigger-Verify Loop

For each test — trigger the action, capture logs immediately (process manager logs, container logs, system journal, etc.), verify (a) no runtime errors, (b) expected output, (c) expected state changes.

## 4. Fix at the Source

Runtime bugs belong to the source project, not the test harness or consumer. Fix root cause → rebuild → restart → retest. Grep for the same pattern project-wide before moving on.

**Never SKIP a test** due to harness/flow issues. On any test failure: (1) identify root cause (application code vs flow/harness/preconditions), (2) fix the source regardless of which project it lives in, (3) retest and verify PASS, (4) only then move to the next test. Consumer-specific bugs (wrong params in test harness, stale test data) are still bugs that must be fixed.

**Diagnose blockers, don't bypass**: When a test hits a stuck step, silent failure, or unexpected state, immediately diagnose the root cause. Never use workflow controls (STEP_OVER, retry, skip, force-cancel) or config changes to bypass without first understanding why. If the root cause is hard to fix, explain the analysis and proposed fix, get user approval, then proceed. Continuing past a blocker without understanding it means the next step's results can't be trusted.

## 5. Set Up Proper Preconditions

When a test fails due to missing state (wrong initial data, wrong device position, stale records), set up the required preconditions and retest — never rationalize the failure as "simulator limitation", "expected fail", or "not a code issue" to justify skipping. Always attempt to set up required preconditions first using available tools/APIs. Only mark a test as SKIP with explicit user approval after demonstrating that precondition setup is technically impossible.

## 6. Remote Environment Diagnosis

When the system under test connects to remote services (simulators, test environments, external APIs), verify whether failures originate locally or remotely. Use SSH, network tools, or remote logs to confirm before assuming a code bug.

## 7. Don't Pivot Scope Without Approval

When the user authorizes a specific test scope (e.g. "full cycle", "end-to-end", "start to end/cancel"), do not silently fall back to weaker verification (isolated unit test, init-only smoke test, code review) on hitting blockers. Hitting a blocker during authorized work requires one of:
1. Actively fixing the blocker (SSH into the environment, orchestrate multi-API calls, modify config) and reporting progress
2. Explicitly requesting user help/approval to try an alternative approach
3. Stopping and asking how to proceed

Never declare a test "complete" or "passed" for a scope narrower than what was authorized.

## 8. Soak Test

After all manual tests pass, let the system run unattended for a defined period and verify zero errors in logs.

## 9. Clean Revert

After testing, revert all test-specific config changes (environment switches, commented-out code, dependency overrides). Never commit test-only modifications.

## 10. Preserve Logs

Never truncate log files during testing (no `pm2 flush`, `truncate`, `docker logs --tail` overwrites, etc.). Intermittent errors may not reproduce on demand, and the only evidence is in the log file. Use `grep` on the full log file directly instead of relying on tail-window commands which may miss errors past the window.

## 11. Test-Time Patches — Isolate, Document, Revert

Test-time only changes (config switches like `config.test.sim`, simulator-friendly preset comments, debug-mode interval shortening, mock auth headers, etc.) MUST be isolated and reverted — never committed to source.

- **Isolation**: keep test-time edits in a **labeled git stash** (`git stash push -m "test-patches: <project>"`) or a dedicated **test-only branch**. Never commit them to feature/main branches.
- **Documentation**: enumerate the patch list (file + change description) in the project's CLAUDE.md or README. Stashes can be lost (manual `stash drop`, `git gc`); the documented list is the recovery source.
- **Apply at session start**: `git stash list` → pop the labeled entry; if missing, re-apply manually from the documentation.
- **Revert at session end**: re-stash with the same label, never commit. Verify `git diff --staged` is clean of test-patch files before any commit.
- **Interval shortening**: if a test requires waiting on a periodic interval (cache refresh, retry backoff, etc.), shorten the constant temporarily as part of the test-patches stash. Don't shorten if the test is specifically validating the timing.

## 12. Multi-Clone Integration Testing

When integrating a test branch into a separate working clone (e.g., production `v1` clone consumes `typescript-migration` clone via `file:` reference), move changes between clones via standard git mechanisms — never ad-hoc directory copy:

- **Preferred (no push needed)**: `git fetch ../<other-clone> <branch>` from the consuming clone, then `git checkout <branch>` or `git merge FETCH_HEAD`. Local-to-local fetch keeps the change set transparent and reversible.
- **Alternative**: `git format-patch` from the source clone → `git am` in the consuming clone.
- **Forbidden**: `cp -r <other-clone>/<files> <this-clone>/` or rsync-style copy. Bypasses git tracking, mixes test changes with working tree, and produces unreviewable state.
- **Symlink-based consumer pattern (do NOT touch the consumer's `file:` ref)**: when the downstream consumer uses an `file:` npm symlink (e.g., node-RED → `bss-core/v1`), the standard way to swap source is to **swap the source clone's git branch**. The symlink stays as is. Editing the consumer's `package.json` to point at a different clone is forbidden.

## 13. Respect User-Stated Mutation Scope

When the user authorizes a specific environment mutation (e.g., "switch nodered branch only", "do all work in dir X"), do NOT mutate anything outside that scope. Before any extra mutation (other files, other repos, package manifests, lockfiles, dependency caches, env vars, parallel clones), STOP and ask. Each unrelated mutation requires its own approval.

- **Examples of out-of-scope mutations to avoid**: editing `package.json` `file:` refs when the user said "change branch", running `npm install` that rewrites lockfiles, deleting `node_modules`, modifying sibling repos, applying patches to a "reference-only" clone, touching configs the user did not name.
- **Designated work directory vs reference-only directory**: when the user says "work in dir X" and mentions another dir Y as "you can refer to its stash / configs", treat Y as **read-only**: read its files, read stash contents, read config patterns — but never `git checkout`, `git apply`, `git stash apply`, or any write to Y. Apply the learned patterns inside X instead.
- **Reverting an unauthorized mutation does not absolve the violation** — the violation IS the mutation itself, regardless of whether it was reverted. Each silent extra mutation erodes trust and may leave subtle leftovers (lockfile diffs, cached symlinks, npm tarball cache, detached HEADs).
- **Stop at first sign of user concern**: when the user expresses any doubt or frustration ("why did you...", "I told you to only..."), immediately STOP all environment work, revert any in-flight mutations, and re-confirm intent. Do not push forward to "complete" the original plan after a user objection — the objection IS new information that invalidates the plan.
- **When in doubt about scope, ask "Should I also do X?" before doing X**. A 5-second confirmation is cheaper than an unwanted environment change followed by trust erosion.
