# Resolve Conflict Workflow

Follow the current user request, applicable project instructions, and Codex permissions. Existing explicit authorization remains valid; do not ask again for the same approved action. These are personal working conventions, not universal language requirements.

Inspect `git status`, the active operation, current/upstream branches, conflicted paths, both sides' commits, and the relevant base. Use the actual upstream, not an assumed main branch.

Explain the cause and intended resolution. Record it in the existing plan if it changes a planned design. Resolve routine conflicts within the already authorized work; ask when conflicting product intent, destructive loss, or a new scope requires a user decision.

Preserve the intended behavior from both sides. Do not accept all of one side, abort a rebase, reset, or reapply a whole branch by default. Resolve the current operation's files, check the combined diff and markers, run relevant verification, stage only resolved paths, and continue with the corresponding merge/rebase/cherry-pick command.

Use the git-commit skill for separately created commits and existing commit/push authorization. Inspect the remote head before pushing; never force-push or rewrite published history without explicit authorization. Record any remaining conflict or failed check accurately.
